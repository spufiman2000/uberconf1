"Be that word our sign of parting, building fiend!" I shrieked upstarting
"Get thee back to Sonatype deep in the night's Plutonian shore!
Leave no jar file as a token of that lie that soul hath spoken
Leave my project's build unbroken; quit my central source code store!
Take thy POM from out my heart and take thy cache from my code store.
Quote the Maven, "Nevermore."
